                    My final project for IDM232 focuses on ... Conducted as a solo effort, the project was part of a Web Design 
                    class taught by Professor Philip Sinatra. Over the course of 10 weeks, only three assignments helped in the production 
                    of my final project:

                        <li>Final</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    The project operated on a zero-cost budget, aligning with its goal to provide students hands-on experience with 
                    modern design theories and back-end scripting languages. This project also fulfilled the class's learning objectives 
                    by focusing on the development of ...

                    In conclusion, this 10-week project was a success. I met the necessary requirements to achieve my Final Project. I designed and 
                    developed ...

                <p>
                    Through this project, I developed better time management skills and understood the significance of deadlines on a professional level. 
                    Academically...
                </p>

                <p>
                    Reflecting on this 10-week process, I realize it could have been more efficient if I had consistently documented and tracked the feedback I received. 
                    This would have allowed me to better evaluate my progress from the beginning of the project to its completion. Adopting a structured cycle of research, 
                    testing, designing, and development would have provided more user perspectives through surveys and other research methods, further enhancing the final
                    outcome.
